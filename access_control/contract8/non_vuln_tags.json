                "Description": "The contract initializes the owner to msg.sender upon deployment, ensuring that the owner variable is correctly set to the deployer's address, which could be utilized in access control."

        {
            "RiskFeature": "Access Control using tx.origin",
            "Description": "The sendTo function relies on tx.origin for access control (tx.origin == owner), which is discouraged as it can be manipulated through external contract calls. This approach could make the contract vulnerable to phishing attacks. Using msg.sender for direct access control checks is generally considered safer and more reliable."

        {
            "RiskFeature": "Missing Fallback Function",
            "Description": "The contract lacks a fallback function, which means it cannot receive Ether directly unless sent explicitly through the sendTo function. This design may limit the contract's flexibility and prevent certain functionalities, such as funding the contract directly from an EOA or another contract."
        },
        {
            "RiskFeature": "Potential Lack of Transfer Security",
            "Description": "The sendTo function directly transfers Ether to the receiver address without additional security checks, such as validating the receiver or enforcing reentrancy protection. This could expose the contract to reentrancy vulnerabilities or accidental misdirected funds if the function is later modified to handle logic-dependent balances."
