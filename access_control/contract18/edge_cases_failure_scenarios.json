{
    "Edge Case Annotations": {
        "Overflow in deposit": "The assert statement in deposit prevents overflow by ensuring the new balance exceeds the previous balance.",
        "Incorrect withdrawal condition": "In the withdraw function, the require condition should be amount <= balances[msg.sender], not amount >= balances[msg.sender]."
    },
    "Common Attack Patterns": {
        "Access control vulnerability": "The incorrect require statement in withdraw allows anyone to withdraw arbitrary amounts of Ether as long as the requested amount is greater than or equal to the user's balance.",
        "Emergency withdrawal by owner": "If the migrateTo function is exploited by a compromised owner, it could drain all funds."
    },
    "Recovery Mechanisms": "The contract lacks emergency stop functionality, leaving it vulnerable to misuse if a critical error is found."
