      {
        "Feature": "Access Control",
        "RiskDescription": "In the withdraw function, the comparison operator is incorrect (it should be `amount <= balances[msg.sender]` instead of `amount >= balances[msg.sender]`). This could allow users to withdraw more Ether than their balance, leading to unauthorized fund withdrawals."
