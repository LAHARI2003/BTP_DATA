  "Cross-Contract Dependencies": {
    "Dependency": "The contract relies on the callee specified in the forward function. It assumes the target contract's code is trustworthy since delegatecall shares the callerâ€™s storage and context."
  },
  "Inter-Contract Consistency Conditions": "Not applicable, as this contract does not directly interact with multiple contracts requiring consistency checks. However, if extended, conditions would ensure external calls are made to known, trusted addresses only."
