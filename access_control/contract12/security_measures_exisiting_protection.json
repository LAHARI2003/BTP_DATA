  "Implemented Security Controls": {
    "Access Control": "The contract lacks an explicit access control on the forward function, allowing anyone to call it and use delegatecall."
  },
  "Risky Usage": {
    "Delegatecall Vulnerability": "The contract uses delegatecall, which can execute code in the context of the proxy contract and alter its storage. It should only delegate to trusted addresses."
  },
  "Fallback Functionality": "Not applicable, as no fallback function is implemented in this contract."
}
