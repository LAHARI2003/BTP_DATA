  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "AccessControl": {
      "Description": "The contract correctly sets the owner variable to the address that deploys the contract in the constructor, ensuring only the deployer has initial control."
    }
  },
  "RiskyFeatures": {
    "DelegatecallUsage": {
      "Description": "The `forward` function uses `delegatecall`, which is known to be potentially dangerous when calling external contracts. If `callee` is an untrusted contract, it can execute code in the context of the `Proxy` contract, leading to state modification or malicious actions."
    },
    "AccessControlInForwardFunction": {
      "Description": "The `forward` function lacks access control checks, allowing any caller to execute it. This may enable arbitrary users to invoke the `delegatecall`, potentially opening security risks if `callee` points to a malicious contract."
    }
  }
}
