    "Implemented Security Controls": {

        "Constructor Issue": "The 'missing' function should have been the contract constructor. As a result, the initial owner assignment can be exploited by any caller.",
        "Access Control Bypass": "The lack of proper constructor allows unauthorized users to take ownership of the contract by calling 'missing' post-deployment."

        "Fallback Function": "The contract includes a payable fallback function that allows it to receive ether. However, no restrictions or checks are implemented for this function."
