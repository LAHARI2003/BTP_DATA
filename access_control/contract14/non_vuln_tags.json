  "risky_features": [
    {
      "tag": "Access Control",
      "description": "The 'sudicideAnyone' function lacks access restrictions, allowing anyone to call it and trigger the self-destruct, making the contract highly vulnerable to attacks."

      "tag": "Improper Function Naming",
      "description": "The function 'sudicideAnyone' is misspelled and may indicate a lack of attention to detail. In a larger contract, such mistakes could introduce further risks if functions are not properly named or reviewed."

      "tag": "Version Control",
      "description": "The contract uses an outdated Solidity version (0.4.0). Later versions include important security updates and improved error handling mechanisms. Using a newer version (e.g., ^0.8.0) would improve the safety of the contract by including modern features such as overflow protection."
