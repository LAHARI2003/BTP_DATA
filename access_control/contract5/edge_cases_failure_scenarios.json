{
  "Edge Case Annotations": {
    "Missing Owner Initialization": "The misnamed constructor leaves the owner variable unset, which could allow unauthorized users to access the contractâ€™s Ether balance.",
    "Ether without Owner": "Since there is no actual owner set, the withdraw function may never work as expected, creating a situation where funds could be locked."
  },
  "Common Attack Patterns": {
    "Access Control Vulnerability": "The contract uses `onlyowner` modifier, but without setting the owner, access control is ineffective.",
    "Ether Drain Attack": "If the owner were set, the `withdraw` function would transfer all Ether from the contract to the owner without further checks."
  },
  "Recovery Mechanisms": "The contract has no fallback or emergency stop function to prevent issues arising from the misnamed constructor."
}
