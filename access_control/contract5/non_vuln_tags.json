      {
        "Incorrect Constructor Declaration": "The function Constructor() is mistakenly defined with a capital 'C' instead of following the standard constructor syntax in Solidity 0.4.24. As a result, this function does not act as a true constructor, potentially leading to unintended access control issues."

Without proper handling, this may lead to accidental ether transfers without any additional functionality or safeguards, creating a risk of funds being inadvertently locked in the contract."
