    "AccessControlVulnerability": {
      "Description": "The changeOwner function lacks an access control modifier, allowing anyone to change ownership, leading to potential unauthorized access.",

      "Description": "The changeOwner function lacks protection and can be executed by any address, potentially leading to loss of contract control.",
