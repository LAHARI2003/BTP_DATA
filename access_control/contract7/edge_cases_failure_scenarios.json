{
  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "UnrestrictedOwnerAddition": "The `newOwner` function lacks the `onlyOwner` modifier, allowing any user to become an owner.",
    "DeletingNonRootOwner": "The deleteOwner function may allow a parent owner to delete their child owner, which could affect trust among owners."
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "AccessControlVulnerability": "The `newOwner` function does not restrict addition to only owners, making the contract susceptible to unauthorized access.",
    "UnauthorizedBalanceWithdrawal": "If ownership is improperly granted, an unauthorized owner could withdraw the entire contract balance."
  },
  "RecoveryMechanisms": "No specific recovery mechanisms (e.g., pausing or emergency stop) are present in the contract."
}
