  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "Invalid Fibonacci Library": "If an incorrect address is set for `fibonacciLibrary`, delegatecall could fail, halting the contract.",
    "Zero Calculated Value": "If `calculatedFibNumber` is zero, no Ether is transferred, resulting in failed or unexpected transactions.",
    "Fallback Function Abuse": "Unrestricted access to the fallback function allows users to modify contract state or call arbitrary functions in `fibonacciLibrary`."

  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "Access Control Vulnerability": {
      "Description": "The fallback function allows arbitrary delegatecall access, creating a risk of malicious state changes.",
      "Lines": [38]
    },
    "Delegatecall Injection": {
      "Description": "If `fibonacciLibrary` is compromised, any function calls in `FibonacciBalance` could manipulate its state.",

    "Suggestion": "Consider implementing an emergency stop or access control mechanisms to disable delegatecall functionality temporarily."
