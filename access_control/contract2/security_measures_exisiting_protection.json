{
  "ImplementedSecurityControls": {
    "Delegatecall with Fibonacci Library": {
      "Purpose": "Offloads Fibonacci calculations to an external library to simplify the contract.",
      "Limitations": "Lacks access control, posing a risk if `fibonacciLibrary` is compromised."
    }
  },
  "Security Vulnerabilities": {
    "Access Control": {
      "Issue": "Lack of access control on the fallback function allows unrestricted delegatecall.",
      "Suggested Mitigation": "Implement an onlyOwner modifier or similar mechanism to restrict access."
    },
    "Reentrancy": {
      "Issue": "The `withdraw` function transfers Ether after delegatecall, potentially allowing reentrancy.",
      "Suggested Mitigation": "Ensure checks-effects-interactions pattern is followed or use reentrancy guards."
    }
  },
  "Fallback Functionality": {
    "Usage": "Enables calling arbitrary functions in `fibonacciLibrary`.",
    "Risks": "Can be abused to alter the contract state or exploit vulnerabilities in the library."
  }
}
