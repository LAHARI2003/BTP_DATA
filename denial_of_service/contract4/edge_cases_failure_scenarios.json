  "EdgeCasesAndFailureScenarios": {
    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
      "HighVolumeArrayFilling": "The loop inside ifillArray adds multiple entries per call. Exceeding the gas limit is possible when listAddresses becomes large, potentially leading to denial of service.",
      "ExcessiveArrayClearing": "The array is reset when it reaches 1500 elements, which may happen frequently, especially in high-traffic scenarios."

      "Denial of Service due to gas limit - The ifillArray function could run out of gas when listAddresses becomes excessively large."
