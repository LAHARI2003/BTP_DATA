{
  "Contract": "DosAuction",
  "Well-Implemented Features": {
    "Bid Requirement": "The bid function requires that the new bid must be higher than the current bid using require(msg.value > currentBid), ensuring only valid bids are processed."
  },
  "Non-Vulnerable Tags": {
    "Access Control": "The bid function only allows changes to currentFrontrunner and currentBid through valid bid amounts, controlling access indirectly by requiring a higher bid to become the frontrunner.",
    "Money Flow Integrity": "The contract manages the state update of currentFrontrunner and currentBid in a consistent manner, ensuring the frontrunner address and bid amount always reflect the highest bid at any given time.",
    "Invariant Validation": {
      "Bid Consistency": "The bid function validates that currentBid is always less than msg.value before updating currentFrontrunner and currentBid, preserving the integrity of the auction's state and ensuring that only higher bids can replace a frontrunner."
    }
  },
  "Potentially Risky Features": {
    "Denial of Service": "The contract is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. If the currentFrontrunner’s address has a fallback function that reverts or exceeds the gas limit, the send operation to refund them will fail, causing the entire bid transaction to revert. This allows malicious frontrunners to potentially block other bids and win by default.",
    "Fallback Function Reliance": "The contract relies on the fallback function of the currentFrontrunner to successfully execute without reverting or consuming excess gas. This design is risky as it exposes the contract to failure if the frontrunner’s fallback function is misbehaving.",
    "Lack of Withdrawal Pattern": "The contract directly refunds the current frontrunner using send rather than implementing a pull-based pattern for refunds. This can cause DoS vulnerabilities and gas limit issues when the frontrunner's address is unable to accept refunds, as the entire bid function will fail."
