    "Implemented Security Controls": [
        "require(numElements > 1500) in `clear` and `clearDOS` prevents clearing the array unless it contains more than 1500 elements, although this is minimal security."
    ],
    "Fallback Functionality": "No fallback function exists; the contract lacks error recovery mechanisms or emergency controls."
}
