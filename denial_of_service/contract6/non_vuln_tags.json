      {
        "Description": "The refundAll function iterates over the entire refundAddresses array, which can grow indefinitely. This can lead to high gas costs, making it possible for the function to fail due to block gas limits.",

    "The contract lacks sufficient access control. It would be beneficial to limit access to the refundAll function, ideally to a specific owner or administrator.",
    "The send function used in refundAll only forwards 2,300 gas, which could prevent the refund from succeeding if the recipient requires more gas. Consider using .call.value() if flexibility is needed, or a pull-based refund model."
