  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "WellImplementedFeatures": {
      "StateInitialization": {
        "Description": "The `win` state variable is initialized to `false` at the time of contract deployment, providing a clear initial state."
      },
      "Controlled State Reset": {
        "Description": "The function `emptyCreditors` is intended to reset the creditorAddresses list under specific conditions (length > 1500), providing a mechanism to avoid unlimited memory usage by creditors."
      }
    },
    "InvariantValidationExamples": {
      "CreditorsLengthCheck": {
        "Description": "The `emptyCreditors` function enforces an invariant that only if `creditorAddresses.length` exceeds 1500, the list is cleared, preventing unchecked list growth."
      }
    }
  },
  "RiskyFeatures": {
    "GasLimitRisk": {
      "Description": "The `addCreditors` function adds up to 350 entries to `creditorAddresses` in one transaction, which could potentially reach the gas limit depending on the state. If not handled properly, this could result in Denial of Service (DoS) issues if `creditorAddresses` becomes too large."
    },
    "DenialOfServiceInEmptyCreditors": {
      "Description": "The `emptyCreditors` function resets the `creditorAddresses` array only if it exceeds 1500 addresses. Once the array reaches this threshold, users may face increased gas costs or a complete denial of service for functions that iterate over or manipulate `creditorAddresses`."
    },
    "CentralizedControlRisk": {
      "Description": "The contract allows any user to call `emptyCreditors` and `addCreditors`, which could potentially be exploited by attackers to manipulate the `creditorAddresses` array and potentially cause performance issues for other users."
    }
  }
