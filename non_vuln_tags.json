          "Description": "The constructor function is incorrectly named as 'missing' instead of 'Missing' (case-sensitive in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0), meaning this function does not execute upon deployment. As a result, the owner variable is never initialized, allowing any user to call withdraw without restriction.",

        {
