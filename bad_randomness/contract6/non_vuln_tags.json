{
  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "Well-Implemented Features": [
      {
        "Feature": "Access Control",
        "Description": "The `lockInGuess` function ensures that only new guesses can be made by checking that the `guesses[msg.sender].block` is 0. This prevents users from reusing their guesses."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Value Transfer Requirement",
        "Description": "The constructor and `lockInGuess` function require an exact value of 1 ether to be sent with the transaction. This ensures that only participants with the required stake can interact with the contract, helping to prevent misuse."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Conditional Prize Distribution",
        "Description": "The `settle` function checks the `block.number` to ensure that the guess was made for a past block, and only transfers funds if the guess was correct. This conditional transfer improves the integrity of the prize distribution logic."
      }
    ],
    "Invariant Validation Examples": [
      {
        "Function": "lockInGuess",
        "Description": "Validates that `msg.sender` has not previously made a guess by requiring `guesses[msg.sender].block == 0`, ensuring that only a single guess can be locked in at a time."
      },
      {
        "Function": "settle",
        "Description": "Validates that the `block.number` is greater than `guesses[msg.sender].block`, ensuring that guesses are settled only after the guessed block has passed."
      }
    ]
  },
  "RiskyFeatures": {
    "Potentially Risky Feature": [
      {
        "Feature": "Dependence on Block Hash",
        "Description": "The contract relies on `blockhash` for randomness, specifically in the `settle` function. However, `blockhash` for blocks more than 256 blocks old returns zero, allowing potential exploitation where an attacker can guess zero and settle after 256 blocks to guarantee a match.",
        "RiskType": "Predictable Randomness",
        "RiskMitigationSuggestion": "Consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an external oracle, to prevent attackers from predicting or exploiting the block hash."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Lack of Access Restriction on `settle`",
        "Description": "The `settle` function does not restrict access, meaning anyone can call it to settle a guess, not just the user who locked in the guess. This could lead to unintended outcomes where others settle guesses prematurely or maliciously.",
        "RiskType": "Open Access",
        "RiskMitigationSuggestion": "Restrict `settle` function access to only the original guesser by checking that `msg.sender` matches the guess owner to prevent unauthorized settlement attempts."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Unreset State in `settle` Function",
        "Description": "Although `guesses[msg.sender].block` is set to 0 after settlement, `guesses[msg.sender].guess` is not cleared, leaving it potentially vulnerable if the state were to be reused or altered unintentionally.",
        "RiskType": "Inconsistent State Reset",
        "RiskMitigationSuggestion": "Consider resetting `guesses[msg.sender].guess` to ensure all guess-related data is cleared after settlement."
