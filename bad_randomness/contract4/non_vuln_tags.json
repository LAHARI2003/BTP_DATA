  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "WellImplementedFeatures": [
      {
        "AccessControl": "The contract correctly restricts access to certain functions (e.g., getBets and destroy) using 'msg.sender == organizer', ensuring only the organizer can perform specific actions."
      },
      {
        "EventLogging": "The contract uses events to log bets made in the 'makeBet' function, allowing easy tracking of bet details (betAmount, blockNumber, and won status) on the blockchain."
      },
      {
        "FallbackFunction": "The fallback function reverts any unintended ether transfers by throwing an exception, ensuring that the contract does not accidentally accept Ether without a valid purpose."
      }
    ],
    "InvariantValidationExamples": [
      {
        "BetRecording": "The makeBet function records each bet's details (amount, block number, and outcome) into the bets array before attempting to send winnings, preserving historical accuracy even if the send operation fails."
      },
      {
        "OrganizerInvariant": "The getBets and destroy functions maintain the invariant that only the 'organizer' can access sensitive information or perform critical actions, like contract destruction."
      }
    ],
    "RiskyFeatures": [
      {
        "RandomnessSource": "The contract relies on block.number for randomness, which is predictable and exposes the contract to potential manipulation by miners. This is not secure for randomness in betting scenarios and can result in BAD_RANDOMNESS vulnerability."
      },
      {
        "UncheckedSend": "The contract uses 'msg.sender.send' to transfer Ether without checking for reentrancy risks. While 'send' limits gas, it's generally safer to use 'call.value' with reentrancy protections or pattern separation to avoid unintended side effects."
      },
      {
        "ErrorHandling": "The use of 'throw' in multiple places (e.g., in fallback, makeBet, and getBets functions) is deprecated in newer Solidity versions and can be improved by using 'revert' or 'require' statements for clearer error messages and gas efficiency."
      },
      {
        "SuicideUsage": "The 'suicide' function is used in destroy to transfer all contract funds to the organizer and delete the contract. This function is outdated; 'selfdestruct' should be used instead, and caution should be taken to ensure it can't be called accidentally or maliciously."
