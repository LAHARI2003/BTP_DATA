    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
        "ZeroOrInvalidBets": "The deal function requires msg.value within the minBet and maxBet range to avoid invalid bets.",
        "ReplayingGame": "The gameIsGoingOn modifier checks if a game is ongoing to prevent re-initializing an already active game.",
        "PredictableRandomness": "The Deck.deal function uses block data for randomness, making it vulnerable to prediction attacks."
    },
    "CommonAttackPatterns": {
        "AccessControlVulnerabilities": "If functions like deal, hit, and stand lacked gameIsGoingOn validation, players could initiate or interact with multiple games improperly.",
        "PredictableRandomness": "The use of block.number and block.timestamp in Deck.deal could lead to randomness prediction, a potential security flaw."
    },
    "RecoveryMechanisms": "No explicit recovery mechanisms, such as pausing or emergency stops, are implemented in the contract."
