    "Access Control": {
      "description": "Proper validation of guess function requirements, ensuring that the function can only be accessed with an ether payment of exactly 1 ether.",
      "lines": [19]
    },
    "Money Flow Integrity": {
      "description": "The contract ensures money flow integrity by validating that if a guess is correct, only the exact amount (2 ether) is transferred back to the winner.",

    "Invariant Validation": {
      "description": "The isComplete function provides an accurate and consistent check on whether the contract balance has been fully depleted, offering an invariant to determine game completion.",

  "potentiallyRiskyFeatures": {
    "Weak Randomness": {
      "description": "The use of block.blockhash and now for randomness is insecure as these values are predictable, allowing attackers to guess the random number with relative ease.",
      "lines": [13],
      "risk": "High",
      "impact": "Predictable randomness allows attackers to reliably guess the answer, leading to potential loss of contract funds."
    },
    "Lack of Access Control": {
      "description": "No restriction on who can call the guess function allows attackers or bots to repeatedly attempt to guess without any limitations.",
      "lines": [18],
      "risk": "Moderate",
      "impact": "This could enable brute force attempts to guess the correct answer, especially since the answer is based on weak randomness."

    "Ether Requirement without Fallback": {
      "description": "The contract requires 1 ether to call the constructor and guess function but does not implement a fallback function, making it less flexible for future updates.",
      "lines": [9, 18],
      "risk": "Low",
      "impact": "If there is a need for contract upgrades or modifications, lack of a fallback function limits contract extensibility and adaptability."
