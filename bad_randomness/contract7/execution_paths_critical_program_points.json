      "Function": "random",
      "Description": "This function generates a 'random' number based on block properties. It calculates different values (x, y, seed, h) and combines them to produce a result."

    "DecisionPoints": [
      {
        "Condition": "max",
        "Explanation": "If `max` is too low, division by a small number can lead to unexpected results or errors. Input should be validated."

    "StateTransitionPoints": [
      {
        "Variable": "salt",
        "Explanation": "Although `salt` is initialized, it isn't modified during execution, which affects the randomness quality."
