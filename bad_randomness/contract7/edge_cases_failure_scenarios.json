    {
      "Case": "Weak Randomness",
      "Description": "The contract relies on predictable block properties (`block.timestamp`, `block.number`), leading to weak randomness that can be exploited."

    {
      "Pattern": "Randomness Manipulation",
      "Explanation": "Miners or validators could potentially influence block properties used to generate 'random' numbers."
