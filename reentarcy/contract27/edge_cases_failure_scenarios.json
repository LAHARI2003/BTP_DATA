  "EdgeCasesAndFailureScenarios": {
    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
      "Reentrancy": "The withdrawAll function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the call.value pattern, allowing potential recursive calls before credit[msg.sender] is set to zero.",
      "Zero or Insufficient Balance": "If the user has zero credit, withdrawAll will not proceed. The check if (oCredit > 0) ensures only positive balances can be withdrawn."
    },
    "CommonAttackPatterns": {
      "Reentrancy Attack": "If withdrawAll is recursively called before credit[msg.sender] is set to zero, it can repeatedly drain the contract balance.",
      "Untrusted External Calls": "Using msg.sender.call.value() opens the contract to external function calls, which can be manipulated if not properly guarded."
    },
    "RecoveryMechanisms": "Currently, no emergency stop or reentrancy guard is implemented in this contract to mitigate reentrancy risks."
