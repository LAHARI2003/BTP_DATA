{
  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "Double Withdrawal": "The getFirstWithdrawalBonus function enables double withdrawal due to reentrancy, allowing attackers to repeatedly call the function before claimedBonus is set to true.",
    "Zero Balance Withdrawal": "If rewardsForA[recipient] is zero, calling withdrawReward results in no actual withdrawal but still incurs gas costs."
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "ReentrancyAttack": "The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy as withdrawReward can be called repeatedly before claimedBonus is set to true."
  },
  "RecoveryMechanisms": "No recovery mechanisms or fallback functions are implemented in this contract."
}
