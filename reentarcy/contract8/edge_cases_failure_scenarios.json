    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": [
      "Zero value deposits: The Deposit function requires msg.value >= MinDeposit to prevent deposits below the minimum.",

    "CommonAttackPatterns": [
      "Reentrancy Vulnerability: The CashOut function uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)() which can be exploited if not properly protected.",
      "Access Control Vulnerability: The setLog function is controlled by tx.origin instead of msg.sender, which could be manipulated under certain conditions."
