                "description": "The `withdrawBalance` function sends Ether using `call.value`, which transfers control to external contracts, potentially allowing for reentrancy attacks if not properly secured. This could be exploited to drain the contractâ€™s funds by repeatedly calling `withdrawBalance` before `userBalance[msg.sender]` is set to 0."

                "description": "The contract lacks a reentrancy guard in `withdrawBalance`, which leaves it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Adding a reentrancy guard would mitigate the risk by ensuring `userBalance[msg.sender]` is set to 0 before making external calls."

                "description": "The `userBalance[msg.sender]` update occurs after the external call in `withdrawBalance`, creating an inconsistent state during execution that can be exploited for reentrancy attacks. The recommended practice is to update state before making any external calls."
