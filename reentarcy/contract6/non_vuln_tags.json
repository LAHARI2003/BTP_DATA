      "WellImplementedFeatures": [
        {
          "Feature": "Access Control",
          "Description": "The onlyOwner modifier is correctly implemented in functions such as changeOwner, WithdrawToken, WitdrawTokenToHolder, and WithdrawToHolder to restrict access only to the contract owner."
        },
        {
          "Feature": "Ownership Confirmation",
          "Description": "The confirmOwner function correctly checks that the new owner is the one calling the function before updating the owner state variable, ensuring secure ownership transfer."
        },
        {
          "Feature": "Minimum Deposit Validation",
          "Description": "The Deposit function correctly validates that msg.value exceeds the minimum deposit (MinDeposit) before updating the Holders mapping, ensuring only valid deposits are accepted."
        }
      ],
      "InvariantValidationExamples": [
        {
          "Function": "WitdrawTokenToHolder",
          "Description": "The function checks if Holders[_to] > 0 before setting it to 0 and executing the WithdrawToken function, ensuring consistency and preventing unauthorized withdrawals."
        },
        {
          "Function": "WithdrawToHolder",
          "Description": "Before executing the call to transfer wei, the function checks if Holders[_addr] > 0 and then reduces the balance after the transfer, maintaining the integrity of the Holders mapping."
        }
      ]
    },
    "PotentiallyRiskyFeatures": [
      {
        "Feature": "Unprotected Initialization",
        "Description": "The initTokenBank function can be called publicly and multiple times, which allows anyone to reset the owner and MinDeposit values, creating a potential security issue. This function should be restricted to only being callable once, preferably using a constructor or a modifier."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Use of Low-Level Calls",
        "Description": "The WithdrawToken and WithdrawToHolder functions use low-level calls (token.call and _addr.call), which can be risky as they do not automatically revert on failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the calls fail, making the contract vulnerable to attacks like reentrancy or failed state updates."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Reentrancy Risk",
        "Description": "The WithdrawToHolder function contains a reentrancy vulnerability as it allows an external address (_addr) to call back into the contract before the Holders mapping is updated, potentially allowing attackers to drain funds through reentrant calls."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "Lack of Event Emissions",
        "Description": "Functions like changeOwner, confirmOwner, WithdrawToken, Deposit, WitdrawTokenToHolder, and WithdrawToHolder do not emit events upon successful execution. This makes it difficult to track critical actions such as ownership transfers and withdrawals, reducing transparency and auditability."
      },
      {
        "Feature": "State Variable Shadowing",
        "Description": "The 'owner' state variable is declared in both the Ownable and Token contracts, causing state shadowing issues. This could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior when accessing or updating the owner state."
      }
