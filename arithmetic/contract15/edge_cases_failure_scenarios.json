    "ZeroValuePurchases": "Not directly prevented; however, users would need to send ether for token purchase to succeed.",

      "AttackType": "Arithmetic Overflow",
      "Description": "Arithmetic overflow in 'buy' and 'sell' functions due to lack of SafeMath checks could lead to unintended results or contract exploitation."

      "AttackType": "Denial of Service",
