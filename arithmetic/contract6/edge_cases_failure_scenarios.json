  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "SubtractionUnderflow": {
      "Description": "When 'v' is greater than 'map[k]', the subtraction will cause an integer underflow.",
      "Mitigation": "Introduce a check to ensure 'v' is not greater than 'map[k]' before performing the subtraction."
    }
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "IntegerUnderflowAttack": {
      "Description": "An attacker can exploit unchecked arithmetic operations by providing large values to cause underflow, resulting in unexpected large values in 'map'.",
      "Location": "Function 'init'"
    }
  },
  "RecoveryMechanisms": {
    "Description": "No recovery mechanism implemented. Recommended: adding checks or a safe arithmetic library like SafeMath to prevent underflow errors."
  }
