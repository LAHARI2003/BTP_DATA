  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "WellImplementedFeatures": [
      {
        "AccessControl": "Functions like deposit, increaseLockTime, and withdraw use msg.sender, ensuring that only the account owner can perform actions on their own balance and lockTime."
      },
      {
        "MoneyFlowIntegrity": "The withdraw function ensures balances[msg.sender] is set to zero after the withdrawal, preventing double-spending and maintaining correct account balances."
      }
    ],
    "InvariantValidationExamples": [
      {
        "InvariantValidation": "In the withdraw function, the contract checks that balances[msg.sender] is greater than zero and that the current time is past lockTime[msg.sender], maintaining state consistency and validating withdrawal conditions."

  "PotentiallyRiskyFeatures": [
    {
      "ArithmeticOverflow": {
        "Description": "The increaseLockTime function is susceptible to integer overflow, which could allow a user to bypass the intended lock time. Using safe arithmetic or overflow checks could mitigate this risk.",
        "SuggestedMitigation": "Use SafeMath library to handle arithmetic operations or add overflow checks on lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease."
      }
    ],
    {
      "LockMechanism": {
        "Description": "The contract relies on a simple timestamp-based lock mechanism, which could be susceptible to time manipulation. Although this is generally safe, external reliance on timestamps may be less secure depending on network conditions.",
        "SuggestedMitigation": "Consider implementing more granular checks or alternate locking mechanisms if higher precision or security is required."
