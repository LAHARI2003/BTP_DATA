    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
        "UninitializedStateExecution": "The run function returns without action if initialized is 0, effectively disabling the function.",
        "UnderflowInCount": "If input is larger than the current value of count, an integer underflow may occur, resulting in a large value for count due to wrapping behavior in Solidity versions prior to 0.8."
    },
    "CommonAttackPatterns": {
        "ArithmeticOverflow": "The run function does not prevent underflows, which could lead to unexpected results in count if input exceeds count."
    },
    "RecoveryMechanisms": "None provided in the current contract, as there are no safeguards against underflows or errors in count manipulation."
