  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "Zero Value Deposits": "The contract does not require a minimum msg.value in functions, allowing zero-value transactions.",
    "Owner-Only Access": "The withdraw and Command functions check if msg.sender is the Owner, preventing unauthorized access."
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "Unchecked Call": "The Command function uses adr.call.value(msg.value)(data), which is vulnerable to reentrancy and unchecked call success.",
    "Access Control Bypass": "If the require checks in withdraw or Command were removed, unauthorized users could execute these functions."
  },
  "RecoveryMechanisms": {
    "Mechanisms": "No explicit recovery mechanisms, such as an emergency stop or circuit breaker, are present."
  }
