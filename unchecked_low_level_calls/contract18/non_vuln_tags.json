        "Feature": "Transfer of Contract Balance in GetHoneyFromJar",
        "Description": "This function sends the entire contract balance to the owner, followed by transferring the balance to the msg.sender without validation of the balance status between transfers. This could lead to unexpected fund distribution if not handled with caution."
