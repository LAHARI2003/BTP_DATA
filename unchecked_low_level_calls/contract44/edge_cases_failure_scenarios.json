  "Edge Cases and Failure Scenarios": {
    "Edge Case Annotations": {
      "Invalid Ownership Transfer": "Ensures only the current owner can change ownership via the changeOwner function.",
      "Reentrant Calls": "The run function uses the next variable to finalize transfers list iteration, reducing reentrancy risk.",
      "Insufficient Token Balance": "Throws an error if the token balance is insufficient at the start of the run function.",
      "Low Gas": "run function halts if available gas falls below 150,000, allowing the function to be called multiple times."

    "Common Attack Patterns": {
      "Unchecked Low-Level Call": "The execute function performs unchecked low-level calls, making it vulnerable to potential exploitation if misused."
    },
    "Recovery Mechanisms": [
      "Owner can use execute to handle unexpected contract states if the TokenSender is no longer functional."
