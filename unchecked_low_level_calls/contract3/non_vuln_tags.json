    "Access Control": {
      "WellImplementedFeatures": [
        {
          "Feature": "Owner Validation in Critical Functions",
          "Description": "Critical functions like `setSupply`, `setBonusCreationRate`, `FundsTransfer`, and `finalize` restrict access to only the contract `owner` or `migrationMaster`, ensuring proper access control."
        }
      ]
    },
    "Invariant Validation": {
      "WellImplementedFeatures": [
        {
          "Feature": "Burn Function Invariants",
          "Description": "In `burn` and `burnFrom`, the contract ensures that the user's balance is sufficient and deducts the amount before updating `totalSupply`, maintaining consistency in token state updates."
        }
      ]
    },
    "Money Flow Integrity": {
      "WellImplementedFeatures": [
        {
          "Feature": "Balance Consistency in Transfers",
          "Description": "The contract utilizes safe mathematical operations in `transfer` and `transferFrom`, ensuring balances are correctly adjusted and updated while avoiding overflows and underflows."
        },
        {
          "Feature": "Direct Ether Handling in Fallback",
          "Description": "Ether sent to the contract is correctly assigned to the sender's token balance in the fallback function when `funding` is true, supporting accurate tracking of user contributions."
        }
      ]
    },
    "State Management": {
      "WellImplementedFeatures": [
        {
          "Feature": "Supply Limit and Funding Control",
          "Description": "The contract includes mechanisms for setting and locking `supplylimit` and managing the funding state, preventing unwanted alterations in token creation."
        },
        {
          "Feature": "Refund and Migration States",
          "Description": "The `refundstate` and `migratestate` flags toggle access to specific contract actions, allowing flexibility while preserving state integrity."
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "RiskyFeatures": [
    {
      "Risk": "Unchecked External Call in PartialFundsTransfer and finalize",
      "Description": "The `PartialFundsTransfer` and `finalize` functions make unchecked external calls (e.g., `owner.send`). Unchecked low-level calls can introduce unexpected behavior or vulnerability if the recipient address fails to receive Ether or has fallback logic."
    },
    {
      "Risk": "Potential Reentrancy in refundTRA Function",
      "Description": "The `refundTRA` function transfers Ether to `msg.sender` without updating the user's balance before the call. This could allow a reentrancy attack if `msg.sender` is a contract with a fallback function that calls `refundTRA` again. Reentrancy protections, such as updating balances before the transfer or using a reentrancy guard, are recommended."
    },
    {
      "Risk": "Lack of Emission Cap in Minting (createDaoPOLSKAtokens)",
      "Description": "While `supplylimit` is intended to cap token issuance, the `createDaoPOLSKAtokens` function allows continuous issuance until the cap. If not monitored, this function could be abused to mint tokens disproportionately, potentially diluting token value."
    },
    {
      "Risk": "Unprotected State Change in setTokenInformation",
      "Description": "The `setTokenInformation` function allows the owner to modify token `name` and `symbol` post-deployment. This flexibility could be misused, causing confusion among token holders. Consider requiring multi-signature approval for such changes."
    },
    {
      "Risk": "Migration Mechanism Risk (migrate)",
      "Description": "The `migrate` function permits token migration without verifying the destination contract's validity. Since `migrationAgent` is externally set, if not verified, it could enable the transfer of tokens to an unintended or malicious contract. It is advisable to ensure that `migrationAgent` meets expected standards and has been audited."
