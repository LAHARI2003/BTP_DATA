  "EdgeCaseAnnotations": {
    "OwnershipTransfer": "If the new owner does not call `acceptOwnership`, ownership remains untransferred.",
    "ArbitraryCalls": "If `execute` is used improperly, it may expose the contract to unexpected external calls."
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": [
    "Unchecked Call Vulnerability": "The `execute` function includes unchecked low-level calls, which can lead to reentrancy or other call-related vulnerabilities if used on untrusted contracts.",
    "Ownership Attack": "Without proper validation, an unintended owner could gain control if the transfer process is not managed securely."
  ],
  "RecoveryMechanisms": {
    "EmergencyStop": "None implemented, but an emergency stop on the `execute` function could help in case of an exploit or error."
  }
