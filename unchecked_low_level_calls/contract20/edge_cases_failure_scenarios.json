    "EdgeCaseAnnotations": [
        "Insufficient Ether for `GetFreebie`: If `msg.value <= 1 ether`, the balance transfer logic is bypassed.",
        "Unauthorized Withdrawals: `withdraw` function requires `msg.sender == Owner`, protecting from unauthorized access.",
        "Unchecked Call Success in `Command`: External call success is unchecked, which may lead to silent failures if the call fails."
    ],
    "CommonAttackPatterns": [
        "Access Control Bypass: `withdraw` ensures only the Owner can withdraw funds, which could be vulnerable if ownership is transferred unintentionally.",
        "Reentrancy Risk: `GetFreebie` and `Command` use low-level call functions, introducing potential reentrancy vulnerabilities if an attacker-controlled contract initiates recursive calls."
    ],
    "RecoveryMechanisms": "No recovery mechanisms are implemented; missing mechanisms to halt contract execution or pause withdrawals in case of a vulnerability."
