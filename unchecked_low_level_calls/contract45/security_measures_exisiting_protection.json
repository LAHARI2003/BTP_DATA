{
    "Implemented Security Controls": {
        "No Access Control": "No modifiers restrict who can call makeOldFucks, leaving the function open to any caller."
    },
    "Identified Vulnerabilities": {
        "Unchecked Low-Level Call": {
            "Description": "The contract uses low-level calls without checking the return value, making it vulnerable to failures that could propagate unexpected behavior."
        },
        "Loop Execution Risk": {
            "Description": "Excessive looping in makeOldFucks with a high `number` parameter could lead to high gas costs or out-of-gas errors."
        }
