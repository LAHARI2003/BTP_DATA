{
    "Edge Case Annotations": [
        "_tos array empty": "The `transfer` function requires `_tos.length > 0` to prevent an empty transfer attempt.",
        "Mismatched `_tos` and `v` array lengths": "The function does not validate length consistency between `_tos` and `v`, potentially leading to incorrect transfers."
    ],
    "Common Attack Patterns": [
        "Unchecked Low-Level Calls": "The use of `call` without checking the return value may allow unexpected behavior or unsuccessful transfers without notification."
    ],
    "Recovery Mechanisms": "No specific recovery mechanisms are implemented, such as requiring confirmation of transfer success or using a try-catch approach."
