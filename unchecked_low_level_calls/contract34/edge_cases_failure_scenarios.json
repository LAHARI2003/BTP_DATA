    "ZeroValueDeposits": "The fallback function does not have a check for zero value deposits, meaning it will accept deposits of 0 Ether.",
    "InsufficientBalanceWithdrawals": "The withdraw function lacks a balance check before the call, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the balance is 0."
  },
  "CommonAttackPatterns": {
    "ReentrancyAttack": "The withdraw function's use of msg.sender.call without precautions makes it vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, allowing repeated withdrawals."

    "NoneImplemented": "No emergency stop or reentrancy guard implemented."
