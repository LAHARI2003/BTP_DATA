    "Edge Case Annotations": {
        "Zero Value Withdrawals": "If the withdraw function is called with _value set to zero, it will still execute but transfer no funds.",
        "Unchecked Calls": "The sendMoney function performs an unchecked call, potentially causing errors or re-entrancy vulnerabilities in certain scenarios.",
        "Unauthorized Access": "The require checks in withdraw and sendMoney prevent unauthorized access, but any failure here can expose the contract to misuse by non-owners."
    },
    "Common Attack Patterns": [
        {
            "Re-Entrancy Attack": "The unchecked call in sendMoney could allow for re-entrancy attacks if the target contract is malicious."
        },
        {
            "Unchecked Call Vulnerability": "Using call.value in sendMoney without checking for success can lead to lost funds if the transfer fails."
        }
    ],
    "Recovery Mechanisms": {
        "None": "The contract does not include emergency stop mechanisms or owner change capabilities in case of compromise."
    }
