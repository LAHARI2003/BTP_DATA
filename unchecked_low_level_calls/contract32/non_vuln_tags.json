  "NonVulnerableTags": {
    "WellImplementedFeatures": [
      {
        "AccessControl": "The contract uses the onlyOwner modifier on critical functions (withdrawAll, withdraw, and sendMoney), ensuring that only the contract owner can execute these actions."
      },
      {
        "MoneyFlowIntegrity": "The depositsCount variable is incremented each time the fallback function is called, providing a reliable count of incoming deposits to the contract."
      }
    ],
    "InvariantValidationExamples": [
      {
        "BalanceValidation": "The withdraw function checks that onlyOwner can withdraw a specific amount, ensuring ownership control over the contract balance."
      }
    ]
  },
  "RiskyFeatures": {
    "UncheckedCall": "The sendMoney function uses a low-level call (_target.call.value(_value)()), which does not check for errors. This may lead to unhandled failed calls, risking fund loss or reentrancy issues if the target contract is malicious or does not accept the value transfer.",
    "DirectFallbackUsage": "The contract relies on the fallback function for deposits without additional validation, which might increase susceptibility to unexpected behavior, especially if the fallback function is not explicitly defined to handle certain input data or gas limitations.",
    "UnrestrictedWithdrawalFunction": "The withdrawAll function allows the owner to withdraw the entire contract balance, which while protected by onlyOwner, could pose a risk if ownership changes unintentionally or if there is a compromise in the ownerâ€™s private key."
