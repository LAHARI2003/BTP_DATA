{
  "nonVulnerableTags": {
    "WellImplementedFeatures": [
      {
        "AccessControl": "Correct usage of onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to critical functions such as withdrawAll, withdraw, and sendMoney."
      },
      {
        "StateManagement": "The contract correctly updates depositsCount whenever a new deposit is received, providing a reliable counter for deposit events."
      }
    ],
    "InvariantValidationExamples": [
      {
        "InvariantBalanceReduction": "The withdraw function checks that msg.sender is the owner and transfers the specified balance to the owner. This helps maintain balance integrity by ensuring only the owner can withdraw."
      }
    ]
  },
  "riskyFeatures": [
    {
      "UncheckedExternalCalls": "The sendMoney function uses a low-level call without verifying the call's success, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities or unintended state changes."
    },
    {
      "FallbackFunctionUsage": "The contract relies on a fallback function to increase depositsCount, which could lead to incorrect counting if unexpected ether is sent to the contract (e.g., via self-destruct of other contracts)."
    },
    {
      "NoEventLogging": "Key functions such as withdrawAll, withdraw, and sendMoney do not emit events. This lack of logging may hinder tracking of fund movements, making it difficult to audit contract interactions."
    },
    {
      "NoFunctionForOwnershipTransfer": "The contract lacks a mechanism for the owner to transfer ownership, potentially creating management issues in the event of owner key loss or change."
    }
