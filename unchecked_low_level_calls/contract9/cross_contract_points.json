    "Cross-Contract Dependencies": "This contract is dependent on an external token contract for executing token transfers via the transferFrom function. The dependency is managed through an address parameter passed to the transfer function.",
    "Inter-Contract Consistency Conditions": "The consistency relies on the external token contract to implement the transferFrom function as expected. If the function does not exist or behaves differently, this contract's functionality may fail."
