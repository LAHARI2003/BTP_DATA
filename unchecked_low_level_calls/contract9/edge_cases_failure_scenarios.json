      "Empty Recipient Array": "The transfer function requires _tos.length > 0 to prevent the scenario of transferring tokens with no recipients.",

      "Unchecked External Calls: The low-level call to caddress can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior if the external contract has malicious or faulty code."
