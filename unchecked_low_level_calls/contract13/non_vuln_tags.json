      "UncheckedExternalCalls": "In the getTokens function, the addr.call.value(0 wei)() is an unprotected call to an external contract. This could lead to potential reentrancy attacks if the called contract is malicious or has complex fallback functions.",

      "DirectTransferUsage": "The withdrawEther function uses owner.transfer, which can fail if the receiving address is a contract with limited gas in the fallback function, potentially locking Ether in the contract."
